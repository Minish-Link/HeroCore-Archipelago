# HeroCore-Archipelago Randomizer v.1.0.0
## By MinishLink

### Setup
To connect to a server, change the values in the ConnectionInfo.ini file to match your slot name, server address/port, and password (if there is one), then launch the game and press Connect on the main menu

### Where is the Music?
While I am able to modify and distribute the source code, I may not be allowed to distribute the music files, as they are outside the source project file, So to play it safe I did not include those files.
To get the music, you will need to download the original game at https://remar.se/daniel/herocore.php .
Then just dump the music files from there into the randomizer's music folder.

## What does this randomizer change?
This randomizer lets you turn any of the following into items that can appear anywhere in the world, and their respective locations can contain any random item:
- Destroying Generators
- The Blade, Suit, Blaster, and Pattern Scanner powerups from Bosses
- Level Ups from Bosses
- Computers
- Doors that require you to defeat all enemies in a room.
- Battle Doors
- Save Points

This randomizer allows you to choose any of the three difficulties as your goal, with the option to additionally require up to 10 computers to access the final boss.

## Notes
This early build of the randomizer does not fully support displaying messages received from the server. If you wish to see items that you are sending out, or see more information about items that you are receiving, a Text client is recommended. Universal Tracker is especially recommended, as this apworld comes with maps for each of the difficulties, showing you what rooms are in logic.
